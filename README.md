# Standard-Assessment-Framework-Tool
Rewrites values assigned on an NGSS-aligned 4-point rubric to hard grade percentages.  Used to maintain standards-based grading ledger whilst providing grading software (I used it with a now-trashed version of aspen which no longer sports excel import, and google classroom) with hard percentage values.

Developped because administration demands to provide percentage grades more quickly got in the way of my own data analysis using the four-point system.  This sucker prevented a LOT of unecessary work.

"Skill" here essentially denotes my use of the NGSS SEPs in tandem with content standards.
